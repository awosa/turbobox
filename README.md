Turbobox is an online tool for sketching and sharing instrumental melodies. You can find it here. It is a modification of the original BeepBox, focused on improving ease-of-use.

All song data is packaged into the URL at the top of your browser. When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated to reflect your changes. When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song!

TurboBox is free, as is BeepBox. If you ever feel so inclined, definitely send something to the original creator, John Nesky's PayPal. PLEASE DO!!!!!!!!!
